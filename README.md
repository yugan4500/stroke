# Stroke-Prediction

This is another machine learning project, that with a 94% accuracy, can predict the liklihood of a stroke in a patient. Although pretty accurate, this was just a 
project for my own understanding of Artificial Intelligence and must not be used as a subsitute or a competitior to a doctor's advice.
